# Arts & Crafts

Arts & Crafts is a child theme for visual artists and craftspeople.
It enhances Twenty Twenty-Five with templates, patterns and styles that focus on showcasing portfolio items.
Currently, it's also used to test WordPress functionality, specifically features that allow for theme authoring within WordPress Playground.
